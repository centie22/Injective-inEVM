# Injective Ethereum Virtual Machine (inEVM)

With so many blockchain ecosystems and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) being the dominant smart contract platform over the years, two questions came to the forefront:
* How can true composability be achieved?
* How can Injective bridge the gap and foster seamless interaction with the vast Ethereum ecosystem?

> Injective is the Layer-1 blockchain built to reshape the future of finance by creating a truly free and inclusive financial system through decentralization. It is a lightning fast interoperable layer one blockchain optimized for building the premier Web3 finance applications


In this article, we will discuss Injective Ethereum Virtual Machine (inEVM) and its benefit to the Injective and Ethereum ecosystems.

### What is inEVM?  
inEVM is an EVM rollup developed to allow developers seamlessly deploy Ethereum Decentralized Application (dApps) onto the Injective chain. Basically, inEVM acts as a bridge between the Injective and Ethereum ecosystems. 
An EVM rollup is 


### Motivation Behind inEVM  
The motivation behind inEVM is breaking down the blockchian silos and facilitate cross-chain composability between Ethereum and Injective. While DeFi has advanced tremendously till date, it remains a fragmented space because it is built on separated blockchain networks. Injective's goal is to unify the fragmented DeFi space. It is able to achieve this with inEVM by:  

1. Making it easy to move existing dApps from Ethereum to Injective.  
2. Allowing developers tap into Injective's advantages like MEV resistance, fast finality, and advanced derivatives protocol for their Ethereum dApps.  
3. Fostering the birth of innovative dApps that combine the strengths of both Ethereum and Injective, hence, opening new frontiers for DeFi applications. 

### Technology Behind inEVM  
The technology behind inEVM lies in its unconvetional architecture:  
* EVM Compatibility: Essentially, EVM is fully compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine. This means that Solidity smart contracts can smoothly run on the Ethereum chain without modifications.  

* Scalability and Speed: inEVM inherits the benefits of Injective's Tendermint consesus mechanism, thereby offering fast transaction finality and high throughput. This equates to faster and more efficient operations for dApps compared to Ethereum mainnet.  

* Cross-Chain Integration: inEVM harnesses Injective's Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to connect seamlessly with other major networks like Solana and Cosmos. This sets the stage for truly cross-chain dApps that interact with applications and assets across various ecosystems. 

### Benefits for Everyone: Developers, users, Ecosystem  
inEVM unlocks a plethora of benefits for various stakeholders. Let us highlight some of these benefits: 

* **Developers**: 
1. Access to wider user base and liquidity pools by moving thier dApps from Ethereum to Injective. 
2. Leverage Injective's uniques features in developing DeFi applications with advanced functionalties.

* **Users**: 
1. Access Ethereum dApps on Injective at lower fees and enjoy wider range of DeFi options. 
2. Benefit from Injective's cross-chain capabilities and MEV resistance mechanisms. 

* **Ecosystem**: 
1. Promote cross-chain innovation and attract developers and dApps from the Ethereum ecosystem. 
2. Increase the overall liquidity and trading volume within Injective; thus solidifying its position as a DeFi hub. 

### What Does inEVM Mean for Injective? 
Aside from being a a technical wonder, inEVM signifies a transformative step for Injective. It represents a dedication to an interconnected future where blockchains collaborate rather than compete. 
With inEVM,Injective brigs Ethereum to the table, developing a DeFi powerhouse fueled by the combined features of speed, security, and innovation. It opens up a world where dApps seamlessly flow across networks, maximizing each other's unique features to create a more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly financial market. 

## Conclusion 
inEVM is redefining the future of DeFi
