## Injective Ethereum Virtual Machine (inEVM)

With so many blockchain ecosystems and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) being the dominant smart contract platform over the years, two questions came to the forefront:
* How can true composability be achieved?
* How can Injective bridge the gap and foster seamless interaction with the vast Ethereum ecosystem?

> Injective is the Layer-1 blockchain built to reshape the future of finance by creating a truly free and inclusive financial system through decentralization. It is a lightning fast interoperable layer one blockchain optimized for building the premier Web3 finance applications


In this article, we will discuss Injective Ethereum Virtual Machine (inEVM) and its benefit to the Injective and Ethereum ecosystems.

### What is inEVM?  
inEVM is an EVM rollup developed to allow developers seamlessly deploy Ethereum Decentralized Application (dApps) onto the Injective chain. Basically, inEVM acts as a bridge between the Injective and Ethereum ecosystems. 
An EVM rollup is 


### Motivation Behind inEVM  
The motivation behind inEVM is breaking down the blockchian silos and facilitate cross-chain composability between Ethereum and Injective. While DeFi has advanced tremendously till date, it remains a fragmented space because it is built on separated blockchain networks. Injective's goal is to unify the fragmented DeFi space. It is able to achieve this with inEVM by:  

1. Making it easy to move existing dApps from Ethereum to Injective.  
2. Allowing developers tap into Injective's advantages like MEV resistance, fast finality, and advanced derivatives protocol for their Ethereum dApps.  
3. Fostering the birth of innovative dApps that combine the strengths of both Ethereum and Injective, hence, opening new frontiers for DeFi applications.
